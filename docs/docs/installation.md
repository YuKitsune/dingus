# Installation

As of right now, Gecko can only be installed using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/YuKitsune/gecko
```

Once Gecko is in a more stable state, it will be available for installation through various packages managers such as Brew, Flatpak, Nix, and more.
